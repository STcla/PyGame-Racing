# PyGame-Racing
A racing game made with PyGame
Coded after the online tutorial at https://coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/ with a few modifications made by me

There is a game.py file with all the code for the game and a sources folder with the sprites, audio, original tutorial code and zip file.

Comments on where to improve the code are welcome!
